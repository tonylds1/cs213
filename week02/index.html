                    Hello, my name, as the title says, is Tony Moraes. <strong>I am from Brazil</strong>, 
                    although love my country I want to live in United States someday. 
                    I have made 8 semesters of Computer Science, traditional mode, but at 
                    the last semester I lost the scholarship I had and have no condition 
                    to keep me in the course. So, this is a great opportunity to get my 
                    <b>College Degree in Software Development, the major I chose</b>.
                </p>
                <h2> Below are my semester Schedule.</h2>
